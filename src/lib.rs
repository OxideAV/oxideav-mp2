//! # oxideav-mp2
//!
//! **Status:** orphan-rebuild scaffold (post 2026-05-18 audit, reset
//! 2026-05-24).
//!
//! The prior implementation was retired under the workspace clean-room
//! policy: the provenance of its bit-allocation and synthesis-window
//! data tables could not be defended as clean-room (they were
//! transcribed from external library source rather than derived solely
//! from the ISO/IEC specification). The crate will be re-implemented
//! from scratch against the staged ISO/IEC 11172-3 / 13818-3 spec in a
//! future clean-room round.
//!
//! Every public API currently returns [`Error::NotImplemented`].

#![warn(missing_debug_implementations)]
